        <p><pre>
            The bird eats the lizard.
            Her scales scratch his throat
            Her body sits inside his stomach 
            In an acid moat.
            The problem is, she's poison too.
            She'll rot his stomach lining
            The acid will leak through his body
            And leave him sick and whining
            Still, she's dead already so
            It will not fix her plight
            The poison's going to kill him
            It's purely out of spite.</pre>
