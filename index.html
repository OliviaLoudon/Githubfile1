<h1>Hello!!</h1>
<p><pre>
    The bird eats the lizard.
    Her scales scratch his throat
    Her body sits inside his stomach 
    In an acid moat.
    The problem is, she's poison too.
    She'll rot his stomach lining
    The acid will leak through his body
    And leave him sick and whining
    Still, she's dead already so
    It will not fix her plight
    The poison's going to kill him
    It's purely out of spite.</pre>
