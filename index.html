        <p>The bird eats the lizard.</p>
        <p>Her scales scratch his throat</p>
        <p>Her body sits inside his stomach </p>
        <p>In an acid moat.</p>
        <p>The problem is, she's poison too.</p>
        <p>She'll rot his stomach lining</p>
        <p>The acid will leak through his body</p>
        <p>And leave him sick and whining</p>
        <p>Still, she's dead already so</p>
        <p>It will not fix her plight</p>
        <p>The poison's going to kill him</p>
        <p>It's not survival, it's spite.</p>
