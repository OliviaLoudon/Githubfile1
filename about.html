 <p>I've been writing a lot of rhyming poems lately. I first had the idea when we made the test website last week. Then I decided to try and play around with the formatting of the other two poems. The roller coaster one was harder, because it was difficult to get the formatting the way I wanted it to look. I ended up having to brute force it a little bit with the "pre" tag. The No Picture poem was easier to figure out, I just set the individual tags for the colors of each lines. If you haven't figured out the trick with that one yet, you need to highlight the last line to be able to see it and finish the poem.</p>
